# Mya

[![Specs](https://github.com/seven1m/mya/actions/workflows/specs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/seven1m/mya/actions/workflows/specs.yml)

This is maybe going to be a statically-typed subset of the Ruby language. Or it could become something else entirely! It's mostly a playground for learning about type systems and inference.

This is also my first foray into using LLVM as a backend, so there's a lot of learning going on here!

I have documented some of my progress on this project via my YouTube channel, in a playlist
called [Compiler Fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTMsH69_lmE&list=PLWUx_XkUoGToXnl24MJFaY95f4YHv5g4B).

The name "mya" is just a working name... it will likely change.
