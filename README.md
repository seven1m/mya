# Mya

[![Specs](https://github.com/seven1m/mya/actions/workflows/specs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/seven1m/mya/actions/workflows/specs.yml)

This is a work-in-progress statically-typed compiler for a language with a Ruby-like syntax.

I have documented some of my progress on this project via my YouTube channel, in a playlist
called [Compiler Fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTMsH69_lmE&list=PLWUx_XkUoGToXnl24MJFaY95f4YHv5g4B).

The name "mya" is just a working name... it will likely change.
