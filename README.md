# Mya

[![Specs](https://github.com/seven1m/mya/actions/workflows/specs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/seven1m/mya/actions/workflows/specs.yml)

This is a work-in-progress statically-typed compiler for a language with a Ruby-like syntax.

My goal is to make a statically-typed subset of the Ruby language, with mostly the same semantics. And I'd love to introduce no new syntax so the same program can run with Ruby and with Mya. But this is all just experimental and we'll see where it goes! :-)

I have documented some of my progress on this project via my YouTube channel, in a playlist
called [Compiler Fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTMsH69_lmE&list=PLWUx_XkUoGToXnl24MJFaY95f4YHv5g4B).

The name "mya" is just a working name... it will likely change.
